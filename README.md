# BRAIN GAMES Project
## Install instructions
To install all dependenses and pacatges just run "make install".
## Description
This progect consist of 5 games:
1. Checking a number for evenness. A random number is show to the user. And he needs to answer 'yes' if the number is even, or 'no' if it’s odd. To successfully complete the game, the user must answer three questions in a row without errors. To run this game user write 'brain-even' to terminal.
2. Calculator. A random mathematical expression is shown to the user, for example '35 + 16', which must be calculated and the correct answer written down. To successfully complete the game, the user must answer three questions in a row without errors. To run this game user write 'brain-calc' to terminal.
3. Greatest common divisor. Two random numbers is shown to the user, for example '25 50'. The user must calculate and enter the greatest common divisor of these numbers. To successfully complete the game, the user must answer three questions in a row without errors. To run this game user write 'brain-gcd' to terminal.
4. Arithmetic progression. We show to the user a series of numbers forming an arithmetic progression, replacing any of the numbers with two dots. the user must determine this number. To successfully complete the game, the user must answer three questions in a row without errors. To run this game user write 'brain-progression' to terminal.
5. Is the number prime.  A random number is show to the user. And he needs to answer 'yes' if the number is prime, or 'no' if it’s complex. To successfully complete the game, the user must answer three questions in a row without errors. To run this game user write 'brain-even' to terminal.
